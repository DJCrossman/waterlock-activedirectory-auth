# Waterlock ActiveDirectory Auth

waterlock-activedirectory-auth is a module for [waterlock](http://waterlock.ninja/)
providing a ActiveDirectory authentication method for users either based on username or email.

Build upon [Waterlock Local Auth](https://github.com/waterlock/waterlock-activedirectory-auth) and [ActiveDirectory for Node](https://github.com/gheeres/node-activedirectory).

## Usage

```bash
npm install waterlock-activedirectory-auth
```

set the following option in your `waterlock.js` config file

```js
authMethod:[
  {
    name: "waterlock-activedirectory-auth",
    url: string,
    baseDN: string,
    bindDN: string,
    bindCredentials: string,
    passwordReset: {
      tokens: boolean, // object containing information regarding password resets

      // object containing information about your smtp server, see nodemailer
      mail: {
        options: string, // how it is use te transport method, see nodemailer
        from: string, // the from address
        subject: string, // the email subject for password reset emails
        forwardUrl: string // the url to send the user to after they have clicked the password reset link in their inbox (e.g. a form on your site which POST to `/auth/reset`)
      },

      // object containing template information for the reset emails
      template:{
        file: string, // the relative path to the `jade` template for the reset emails
        vars: object, // object containing any vars you want passed to the template for rendering
      }
    },
    createOnNotFound: boolean // should local auth try to create the user on a failed login attempt, good if you do not want to implement a registration form.
  }
],
ldap: {
  url: string // A valid LDAP URL (proto/host/port only) ie. 'ldap://dc.domain.com',
  baseDN: string // The alternative baseDN to use than the one specified in the ctor. ie. 'dc=domain,dc=com',
  username: string // ie. 'username@domain.com',
  password: string // ie. 'password'
  // Addtional params here: https://github.com/gheeres/node-activedirectory
}
```

## Auth Model
Local auth adds the following attributes onto the Auth model

```js
  email: {
    type: 'email',
    unique: true
  },
  password: {
    type: 'STRING',
    minLength: 8
  },
  resetToken: {
    model: 'resetToken'
  }
```
with the way waterlock is designed and this model you can override any of these attributes, also if you want to use a username instead of an email address you can drop in the `username` attribute which is a signification key causing local auth to use that to authenticate.

<!-- ## Password reset
Waterlock uses [nodemailer](http://www.nodemailer.com/) to send password reset emails. The options in the config file are applied to nodemailer as such
```js
var mail = config.passwordReset.mail;
nodemailer.createTransport(mail.protocol, mail.options);
```

if you choose to go with this option then a user upon visiting the url `/auth/reset` with a post param of `email` will receieve an email at that address with the reset url. This url upon clicked with be validated against the server to ensure it's still within the time window allotted for a password reset. If so will set the `resetToken` session variable. After this if you have set a `forwardUrl` in your `waterlock.js` config file the user will be forwarded to this page.

If you want to take advantage of the built in reset itself have the page you sent your user to above `POST` to `/auth/reset` with the post param of `password` If all is well a password reset will be issued.

## Template
You can customize the email template used in the password reset via the template file defined in `config/waterlock.js` this template file is rendered with the fun and dynamic `jade` markup, the view var `url` is generated and passed to it when a user requests and password reset. You can customize this template to your liking and pass any other view vars you wish to it via the `vars` options in the js file.

Your user can simply try to login to `/login` if the user is not found one will be created using [waterlines](https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline) `findOrCreate` method -->
